# Dataset
Thanks OpenPowerlifting Data Service for the csv we downloaded and used for
this analysis! It can be found using the following link:
https://openpowerlifting.gitlab.io/opl-csv/

NOTE: Our version was from April 13th, 2024. As long as no major changes
were made to the structure of the set, you can download the most recent
and use our structure. This CSV isn't included as it's too large to 
store in the repository.
